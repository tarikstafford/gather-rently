Rently.sg — Brief Design Guide
1. Brand essence

Positioning: Helpful, modern, trustworthy — a brand that makes renting seamless, safe and simple.

Voice: Playful but competent — hero (helpful), citizen (local, grounded), sage (knowledgeable).

2. Logo

Use official logo assets (SVG/PNG). Prefer SVG for scalability.

Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo (at least the height of the logo wordmark or the height of the “R”).

Use the light/white logo on dark plum/dark backgrounds; use the primary (plum) logo on white/neutral backgrounds.

Never distort, recolor (outside approved palette), stretch or crowd the logo.

3. Colour palette (core)

Primary / Brand

Dark plum — #301064

Plum — #553081

Plum stain — #E1CFFF

White plum — #FAF6FF

Neutrals / UI

Dolphin Gray — #7A86A9

Gray 100 — #111010

Gray 90 — #545454

Gray 75 — #AFAFAF

Gray 50 — #EDEDED

Gray 25 — #F9F9F9

Accent / functional

Red (alerts) — #E24949

Sweet mint 100 — #11BB8D

Sweet mint 75 — #B3E3BD

Sweet mint 50 — #D9F2DE

Sweet mint 25 — #F3FFF6

4. Gradients (approved)

Dark Plum Linear: #553081 → #301064

Mint Linear: #DBF5F0 → #40D9B0

Orange–Purple Linear (use sparingly): #F0A83C → #7E3FC8

Use gradients for hero backgrounds, CTAs or social creative accents — don’t overuse.

5. Typography

Primary family: Archivo (headlines and emphasis).

Use Archivo Medium/Bold for headings and emphasis; Archivo Regular for headline/body where needed.

Body/UI: Prefer a neutral system/UI font stack for long-form and interface text for legibility across devices.

Emphasis rule: Use Archivo Medium for extra emphasis on important words.

Follow a clear type scale (Mega Title → Large Title → Title → Headline → Body → Caption). Avoid full-caps; keep headlines to ~3 lines max.

6. Layout & components

Mobile-first: Design for mobile first and scale up to desktop.

Reuse components from the design system (Figma).

Snap elements to guides; maintain consistent spacing tokens from the design system.

For graphs, use brand colours; prefer a simple palette (primary plum for main series, mint for positive signals). Avoid too many colours in one chart.

7. Imagery & photography

Style: Human-first, local, authentic — use real people, local scenes, and employees/customers when possible.

Backgrounds: For dark plum layouts use monochrome or desaturated images so brand colours remain legible and pop.

Photography should feel warm, honest and trustworthy.

8. Iconography & illustration

Maintain a consistent geometric style and stroke width.

Use brand purple or mint for filled icons when emphasising actions; grayscale for neutral states.

Gradients are acceptable for hero illustrations but should be used sparingly.

9. Motion & interaction

Use small, purposeful motion: quick, optimistic micro-interactions (hover, subtle transitions). Motion should feel professional and not gimmicky.

10. Copy & tone

Tone: Playful, friendly, confident, and helpful. Make complex things feel simple.

Use short sentences and local references where helpful.

Be the helpful hero — explain benefits clearly and kindly.

11. Dos & Don’ts

Do

Use official logo assets and brand colours for CTAs and charts.

Design mobile-first and reuse design-system components.

Emphasise with Archivo Medium where needed.

Don’t

Don’t alter predefined font sizes or move text boxes off grid/guides.

Don’t mix too many brand colours in one layout or chart.

Don’t stretch, recolour or warp the logo.

12. Where to find assets & next steps

Keep the design system (Figma) and Brand Guidelines PDF as the source of truth for tokens, components, and downloadable assets.

Use web-hosted SVGs for production assets.

For any production work, pull swatches, tokens, and components from the design system to ensure consistency.
